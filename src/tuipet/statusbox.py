"""THE status box — every right-hand card in one module (Joel 2026-07-17:
"MODULIZE THE STATUS BOX").

One card per surface, registry-dispatched; app.py only delegates.  The rule
of this file: **a card may only show LIVE data** — when a system leaves the
game, its rows leave here the same day.  The move itself killed three liars:
the feeding readout's protein/mineral/vitamin bars (the nutrition system was
removed 2026-07-16; the macros are frozen at their 6/6/6 starter values
forever), the DNA card's "spirit/mood" charge bill (both systems are gone —
the real bill is ENERGY, 1/unit on your own Field, doubled off-Field), and
the home card's Power/HP rows (moved/retired earlier the same day).

Every painter takes the app (pet, mode, stats_w, sound) and writes the
26-col card; `card()` is the shared frame.  Fit is pinned by
tests/test_status_box*.py against CARD 26x16.
